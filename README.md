## Manual Installation

If you already have a Hugo site on your machine, you can simply add this theme via

```
git submodule add https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-product-launch.git themes/hugo-product-launch
```

Then, adjust the `config.toml` as [detailed below](#usage).

For more information, read the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) of Hugo.

#### Example Content

Simply copy over the contents of the `exampleSite`-directory included in this theme to your source directory. That should give you a good idea about how things work, and then you can go on from there to make the site your own.

#### NodeJS Dependencies

You need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed. Then, copy the `package.json`- & `package-lock.json`-files from the root of this theme to your site's root. Run `npm install` & `npm install postcss-cli postcss -g` to set up your [PostCSS-Pipe](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/postcss/).

#### Take over `main.css` & `tailwind.config.js`

Simply copy over the `assets/css/main.css`-file from this repo into your local `assets/css`-folder. Also, copy the `tailwind.config.js`-file from the root of this repository to your site's root. You may then add any CSS you like into your own `assets/css/main.css`-file and even overwrite the tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`-file. See [tailwindcss > docs > configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) for more details.

#### Optional: Take over `postcss.config.js`

Take full control of the [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)-setup by copying the `postcss.config.js`-file from this repo into the root directory of your site.

## Usage

If you would like to have a nice & clean _no!-code_ User Interface 🧁 for Content Management, simply connect your repository with [Forestry](https://forestry.io). We included the necessary batteries 🔋 (i.e. settings) on the `exampleSite/.forestry`-folder so you are ready to go right out of the gate.

### Base configuration: `config.toml`

Please check out the [`config.toml`](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-product-launch/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml)-file included in the [exampleSite](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-product-launch/tree/master/exampleSite) of this theme.

### Adding Content: `content/_index.md`

Start with the contents provided in the [`_index.md`](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-product-launch/blob/master/exampleSite/content/_index.md)-file in the [`exampleSite/content`](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-product-launch/tree/master/exampleSite/content)-directory. That should give you a good idea about how things work, and then you can go on from there to make the site your own.

This [markdown cheat-sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) might come in handy 🙌🏻.

### Adding your branding / colors / css: `assets/css/main.css`

Check out the [`main.css`](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-product-launch/blob/master/assets/css/main.css)-file from the [`assets/css`](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-product-launch/tree/master/assets/css)-directory to get started and to find more detailed instructions.
